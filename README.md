The goal of this application is to build a task management application that 
will work for both the average person needing to manage their day-to-day life
and teams needing to manage their tasks and missions.

I started building this application about a year ago in Ruby and Ember. Then 
translated it over to NodeJS and Ember. Then went from Ember to Angular. Then 
went from Angular to Backbone. And now the current stack consists of:

* **NodeJS**
* **ExpressJS**
* **ReactJS**
* **MongoDB**
* **Webpack**

I've kept this project running as a sort of testing ground for when I've wanted
to learn some new technology. It's kind of like the basic to-do applicaton that
many people build to display how some new-fangled MVC framework works. I never
liked those because real world developers are not building to-do apps.

We're building apps in the real world for real consumers. These apps have to be
both stable and scalable. The apps we build are not one javascript file with
about 50 lines of code. They're more like 100+ files with 20,000+ lines of code.
So I wanted to take the basic premise of the basic to-do application and build 
out some extra real-world features such as:

* Authentication & OAuth
* File uploading
* Build systems (Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, etc.)
* Testing (Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Jest, Karma, etc.)

My other goal with this application is for it become a sort of snapshot of what 
the current state of web development looks like. It should use the current go-to
tools, frameworks, libraries, architectures, and methodologies that have proven
themselves as "here for the long haul" technologies that every developer should
have in their tool kit and integrated into their stack.

The next things I want to integrate are:

* Server-side error logging
* Client-side error logging
* An analytics layer
* A application dashboard layer
* Two-factor Authentication (NO MORE PASSWORDS!)
* and much much more!

If anyone out there cares and/or wants to through in some ideas and their two 
cents, feel free. Fork, star, raise issues, open pull requests, and so on.
